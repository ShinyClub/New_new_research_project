# Conclusion

Our goal was to make a working dashboard for analysing transcriptome data.   
So far we created an almost completely automated dashboard that can analyse a CSV files. The application isn't fully automated, because the code still has too be adjusted if the user wants to switch between files. The functions that have to be changed are explained below in the discussion.   

# Discussion & Recommendations 

## Discussion

**build_summ_function_csv.R**
The first thing that needs to be checked is the column number of the variable factor. 
row 30 and 31: colnames(phenodata_tbl)[11] <- **"dev_stage"**
colnames(phenodata_tbl)[12] <- **"genotype"**

The size of the phenodata_tbl has to be checked. 
phenodata_csv <- phenodata_tbl[2:41]

Check how many columns there are in the CSV file. 
raw_counts_csv_data <- csv_data[2:21] 

**geom_histogram_function.R**
The variable factor on row 4 has to be changed. 
ddsSE <- DESeq2::DESeqDataSet(se_input, design = formula(~**dev_stage** + **genotype**))  

**heatmap_function.R**
The variable factor on row 4 and 24 has to be changed. 
ddsSE <- DESeq2::DESeqDataSet(se_input, design = formula(~**dev_stage** + **genotype**))  
annot_df <- as.data.frame(colData(ddsDE)[,c(**"dev_stage"**,**"genotype"**)])  

**pca_function.R**
The variable factor on row 4 and 19 has to be changed. 
ddsSE <- DESeq2::DESeqDataSet(se_input, design = formula(~**dev_stage** + **genotype**))  
DESeq2::plotPCA(intgroup = c(**"dev_stage"**, **"genotype"**))  

**pca_function.R**
The variable factor on row 4 and 17/18 has to be changed. 
ddsSE <- DESeq2::DESeqDataSet(se_input, design = formula(~**dev_stage** + **genotype**))  
resLFC <- lfcShrink(ddsDE, 
                      coef = **"dev_stage_age..5.months_vs_age..12.months"**     )    

## Recommendations 
We recommand to create multiple buttons and functions in the UI for different file formats; xlsx, txt, CSV, etc. The user would be able to choose the format and by separating the functions it is easier to create a work flow. This will help to automate the dashboard, since it will trigger the functions especially added for that filetype.  

In the experimental group tab we want to be able to select multiple characteristic(s) and change their name. The dashboard will work with the selected this change would automate a big part of the code and the dashboard.

The figure tab doesn’t work correctly. It automatically creates all the figures instead of one, because of this we want to add a loading bar so the user knows the dashboard is still working.

The download your data tab doesn’t work at all. We want to make a checkbox group where you can select what kind of data you want to download and in what kind of format.
