## Unzipping of the downloaded data

We start the same way as “untar the data”, we tell R where to find the zipped files and select them with the pattern “.gz”.
The new map function will then unzip the files with function GEOquery::gunzip

```{r Unzip files}
files_zip <- list.files(path = here::here(datasets), full.names = TRUE, pattern = ".gz")

unzipp <- map(
  .x = files_zip,
  .f = GEOquery::gunzip
)
```

In these first few steps we have: Downloaded supp_files and data about the experiment and unpacked these files. The next steps will be making sure the data is ready for data-analysis.
